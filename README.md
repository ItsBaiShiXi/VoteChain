## Tech Stack

1) ResilientDB - A cutting-edge blockchain technology chosen for its robustness and immutability, providing secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant data storage essential for our electronic voting system.
2) GraphQL - Utilised for efficient and versatile data querying, offering a streamlined interface to access blockchain based information. Implemented Fetch Transaction, Post Transaction and Send Request APIs using GraphQL.
3) React.js - It was utilized for building composable and interactive user interface within the VoteChain platform, facilitating the creation of modular components and seamless UI interactions.
4) Material UI - A responsive UI design library complementing React.js, ensured a consistent and visually appealing layout across various devices and screen sizes.
5) Node.js - It forms the foundational infrastructure for the VoteChain back end, managing server-side logic and acting as an intermediary between the user interface and ResilientDB blockchain
